## Introduction:

  These two tasks are lab tests on STIA1113-Programming1. I need to complete both tasks within the allotted time, which is one hour and thirty minutes.

  The first task is about using the keyboard input and reading it to distinguish whether it is odd, even or zero.

  The second task is about writing a Java program that reads in a list of integers, one per line, until a sentinel value of 0. When the sentinel is read, your program should display the total, average, maximum and minimum of the input values in the list


## Topics cover: 

-  NUMERICAL COMPUTATION &   EXPRESSION

-  Selection Control Structures

- Looping Structures
